2. **Enter your text** or description
3. **Adjust settings** if needed (optional)
4. **Click Generate** and wait for the result

## ⚙️ Tips

- Adjust **Temperature** for creativity vs. stability (higher = more expressive)
- Use **reference audio** in MOSS-TTS for voice cloning
- In **Continuation** modes, prepend the reference audio transcript to your input text
- Be descriptive in voice/sound descriptions for better results
- Generation time depends on text length and your hardware
